# PayMyProject
PayMyProject is a full stack web application similar to Kickstarter or Patreon. The application includes features such as user login, project following, session cookies through Redis Caching, and payment options. Our application is very ready heavy. Therefore React and a NoSql database would have been more efficient. However, our project requirements included a schemaless database and a templating method. Thus, EJS was used for templating, and MySql was used as a relational database. Thank you.
